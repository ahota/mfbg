# Alok's blog

My static blog generator, based on [MFBG](https://github.com/jeremycw/mfbg)

## Usage

1. create posts in `posts` directory
2. run `make`

## Caveats

posts should start with the first three lines formatted as so to properly
generate index.html:

```
Blog Title
==========
2018-11-20
```
